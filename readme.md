# This is a test Cypress project for learning purposes

I created this project to test various things with cypress and just overall refine my automation skills. - Collin Robison

## To run cypress UI:
`npx cypress open`


## To run headless Cypress (console-only):
`npx cypress open`

## Need to do: 
- Finish hover tests
